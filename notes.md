# Notes

* Unit testing →  testing an unit in isolation from other units.
* They are programmers test
* Unit testing examines the behavior of a unit of work. 
* A unit of work is a task that doesn’t depend on other tasks.

* Test class can be a top level class or static nested class or inner class annotated with @Nested annotation. 
* Test class can’t be abstract and must have a single constructor. Single constructor can be no argument constructor or arguments that can be resolved dynamically at runtime.
+ Test method can be annotated with 
 - @Test
 - @RepeatedTest
 - @ParameterizedTest
 - @TestFactory
 - @TestTemplate

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!
